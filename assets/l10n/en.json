        "Neurostimulation is an innovative and proven technique (first proposed in 1967) that allows you to get an analgesic effect, improve the quality of life and reduce the use of analgesics in patients with neuropathic pain.The effect is achieved with the help of electrical impulses, which are delivered by electrodes implanted in the epidural space.\n\u2705 Electrical impulses activate pain-inhibiting neurons in the posterior horn of the spinal cord, as a result of which the feeling of pain decreases. \n\u2705 stimulation also causes paresthesia (a feeling of soft pleasant vibration) in the area where the pain originates and its surroundings.\n \u2705 The application of SCS is considered successful if it was possible to achieve more than a 50% reduction in pain on a visual-analog scale. \n\u2705 However, a 30% reduction in pain is also clinically significant.\n\u2705 More than 15,000 patients worldwide are implanted with neurostimulators for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain every year",

During the test period, the implantable pulse generator is replaced with an external pulse generator.",

    "descriptioncontrolunit":
        "The doctors programmer or the patients remote control is connected to the pulse generator and transmits control signals. Only sequential use of the programmer or remote control is used without simultaneous use. The pulse generator allows you to synchronize the data of the doctors programmer and the patients remote control. The multiuser mode of the programmer allows you to store data of different patients (in internal memory, cloud or additional removable media, depending on the model). The physical carrier for transmitting parameters is a radio frequency with a minimum interaction radius or Bluetooth.",

        "The implantable electrode is designed to stimulate the spinal cord. The electrode is a thin insulated four-core wire with four, eight or 16 contacts at the tip. The electrode is implanted into the epidural space to conduct an electric current there, which enhances neurostimulation. The optimal position of the electrode is always correlated with the patients pain zone. To stimulate the spinal cord, electrodes are implanted into the epidural space (between the vertebra with the dura mater), while the contacts of the electrodes are close enough to the posterior horn of the spinal cord to stimulate thick myelin nerve fibers.An extension cord and a retainer are supplied with it. At the test stage, a cable is used to connect the implantable electrodes to an external test neurostimulator. The electrodes are made in the form of one or several rows of metal plates with a common terminal, which is either a percutaneous catheter or a tapering plate in the form of a paddle. The electrodes can be either bipolar or multipolar. Increasing the number of contacts allows you to control the electromagnetic field more accurately, but also significantly increases the power consumption, which means you will have to charge the system more often for rechargeable pulse generators or change it for non-rechargeable ones.",
